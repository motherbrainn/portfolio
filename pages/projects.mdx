Create a QR Code that will send a custom text message to your phone when scanned.

### [Tic Tac Toe Vs ↗ ](https://tic-tac-toe-vs.up.railway.app/)

### [DOSBox DooM ↗ ](https://dosbox-doom.up.railway.app/)

Play the original DooM in your browser! This was an easy project but awesome in my opinion hah.

### [Pocket WiFi Free Library ↗ ](https://github.com/motherbrainn/pocket-wifi-free-library/)

Based on a really cool Arduino project - iffybooks/pocket-wifi-portal.
This is a portable wifi portal made to be hosted on a Wesmos D1 mini board. The portal can host articles and has a websocket powered live chat.
There is a demo gif in the github readme!

### [YEEZY RUMORS ↗ ](https://yeezy-rumors-production.up.railway.app/)

Ever wished there was a fast and convenient way to spread rumors about YEEZYS (the shoes)?? Probably
