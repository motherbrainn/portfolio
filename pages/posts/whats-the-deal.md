[Jerry Seinfeld's voice]

So, I've been hearing a lot about this thing called React.js. React.js, it's like the diva of JavaScript frameworks. It's all like, "I'm declarative! I'm component-based! Look at me, I'm so efficient!"

But you know what? I can't help but feel like React.js is that friend who always wants to break everything down into little components. You ask them, "Hey, can you pass the salt?" And they're like, "Sure, let me create a SaltPasser component for you. It'll handle the salt passing in the most efficient way possible!" I mean, come on! Just pass the salt, it's not that complicated!

And don't even get me started on JSX. It's like a mix between JavaScript and HTML. They call it a syntax extension, but to me, it's more like a Frankenstein's monster of code. It's like, "Hey, let's take some HTML, sprinkle in some JavaScript, and see what happens!" It's like watching a magic show where the magician is juggling HTML tags and JavaScript functions. I'm waiting for him to pull a rabbit out of a `<div>`!

But hey, I get it. React.js has its fans. They love its virtual DOM and its reusability. It's like they're in a cult. They're all like, "Join us, Jerry! Embrace the React life!" And I'm like, "No thanks, I'll stick to my good old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript trio. They never let me down."

In the end, whether you're a fan of React.js or not, remember this: websites should be like a good joke. They should be simple, easy to understand, and deliver a punchline that leaves a lasting impression. And if React.js helps you achieve that, well, who am I to argue?

Thank you, and remember, don't let your code be too reactive, or you might end up needing therapy!
